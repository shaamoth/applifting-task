# Applifting Task

The solution to **Task 1** is in the form of PDF file: _T1 - Scenarios.pdf_.
The code for **Task 2** is in the _T2 - Code_ folder.

To make it easier to imagine the layout of the tested application in Tasks 1 and 2, I created sketches of the individual pages. These sketech are in the _T1&T2 - sketches_ folder.

The solution **Task 3** is in the form of PDF file: _T3 - Test Report.pdf_.
