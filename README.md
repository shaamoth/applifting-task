# Applifting Task

The solution to **Task 1** is in the form of PDF file: [T1 - Scenarios.pdf](https://github.com/shaamoth/applifting-task/blob/main/T1%20-%20Scenarios.pdf).

The solution to **Task 2** was implemented in TypeScript using the WebDriver.IO testing framework. The code is in the [T2 - Code](https://github.com/shaamoth/applifting-task/tree/main/T2%20-%20Code) folder.

To make it easier to imagine the layout of the tested application in Tasks 1 and 2, I created sketches of the individual pages. These sketches are in the [T1&T2 - sketches](https://github.com/shaamoth/applifting-task/tree/main/T1%26T2%20-%20sketches) folder.

The solution to **Task 3** is in the form of PDF file: [T3 - Test Report.pdf](https://github.com/shaamoth/applifting-task/blob/main/T3%20-%20Test%20Report.pdf).
